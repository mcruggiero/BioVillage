Phenotype Mapping Key,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 - The disorder is placed on the map due to its association with a gene, but the underlying defect is not known.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 - The disorder was placed on the map by statistical methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 - The molecular basis of the disorder is known.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 - A contiguous gene duplication or deletion syndrome in which multiple genes are involved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
